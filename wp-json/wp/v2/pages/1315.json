The show will include a suite of contemporary watercolor paintings by California-based artist <strong>Timothy J. Clark<\/strong> (b. 1951), best known for his large watercolor paintings. The exhibition is on view at the HSM&amp;L in the East Building Gallery from <strong>June 17, 2022<\/strong> to <strong>October, 16 2022<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><em>American Travelers: A Watercolor Journey Through Spain, Portugal, and Mexico<\/em> brings to the spotlight the museum\u2019s robust collection of watercolors by United States artists painted in Spain, Portugal and Latin America. Works by <strong>Childe Hassam<\/strong>, <strong>Max Kuehne<\/strong>, <strong>George Wharton Edwards<\/strong>, <strong>Ernest Clifford Peixotto<\/strong>, <strong>Florence Vincent Robinson<\/strong>, <strong>Orville Houghton Peets<\/strong> and <strong>Milan Petrovic<\/strong> are presented in conjunction with a collection of recent watercolor paintings by <strong>Timothy J. Clark<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTravel has, unfortunately, been a rarity for many these past few years,\u201d says Guillaume Kientz, Director and CEO of the Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library. \u201cWhile we may not always be able to travel physically, art is fantastic way to transport oneself to another world, offering an instant portal to faraway places. The artists in this exhibition offer visitors access to many different regions, and they were each influenced by Sorolla, having discovered\u00a0the Hispanic world through his works in the HSM&amp;L permanent collections. The museum collections, and particularly Sorolla\u2019s work, ignited their appetites for Hispanic art and culture. This exhibition invites visitors on a journey that is all at once geographical, artistic and personal, allowing us to follow the paths of these trailblazing artists.<\/p>\n<p>The exhibition features 94 works, 83 of which are from the HSM&amp;L permanent collection, including one work by Clark. 11 additional works on display by Clark are sourced from various collections.<\/p>\n<p>Since the days of Washington Irving, Spain has held a fascination for American writers and visual artists. For example, John Singer Sargent painted at the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid and in Granada. Other nineteenth-century North American painters such as William Merritt Chase, Harry Humphrey Moore and Mary Cassatt, and younger artists such as Childe Hassam and Robert Henri, toured and painted in Spain as an essential part of their artistic development. When the Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library opened its doors in 1908, it became a source of inspiration for American artists with Hispanic interests.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis exhibition idea resulted from my study of the works of Childe Hassam in our collection, and the awareness of the role that Hassam\u2019s visit to the 1909 Sorolla exhibition at the Hispanic Sociaty played in his decision to return to Spain in 1910,\u201d says Marcus B. Burke,\u00a0Ph.D., Senior Curator,\u00a0<em>emeritus<\/em> at the Museum Department of the Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library. \u201cThe result was a series of remarkable works that, when displayed in the 2004 Hassam retrospective exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum, documented a remarkable series of Hispanic influences on one of America\u2019s greatest artists. I was also aware of a remarkable series of small oil sketches (pochette panels) made by Max Kuehne around 1920; Kuehne had also been inspired by the Hispanic Sociaty\u2019s collections. \u00a0A decade later, when the traveling exhibition, \u201cSorolla and America,\u201d visited San Diego in 2014, a southern California artist, Timothy J. Clark, attended the show, over half of which had come from the Hispanic Sociaty\u2019s collections.\u00a0 Like Hassam and Kuehne before him, Clark was inspired to return to Spain, and subsequently, return to Mexico, with the precedent of Sorolla in mind.\u00a0 As I came to know Clark and his large-scale watercolors, I began to investigate more fully this aspect of our collection of 6,800 drawings and watercolors. \u00a0To my very pleasant surprise, I found a huge treasure of splendid works of art by now little-known American artists, all of whom had visited Spain with conscious awareness of the Hispanic Sociaty, its Founder, Archer Milton Huntington, and its collections.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez-Ying, Goldschmidt &amp; Rockefeller Curatorial and Conservation Fellow at the Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library says, \u201cThis exhibition epitomizes the view of artists from the United States supported by Archer Huntington\u2019s intellectual curiosity and fascination with Spain and its culture in an effort to preserve its memory from the clashes of modernity and industrialization.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Luso-Hispanic decorative arts objects [from the museum\u2019s holdings] offer a nuanced cultural framework, which breathes new life into these kaleidoscopic groupings of American watercolors,\u201d says Alexandra Frantischek Rodriguez, Decorative Arts Curatorial Research Fellow at the Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library.<\/p>\n<p>The first works visitors encounter in the exhibition are the paintings of Childe Hassam (1859\u20131935), who visited the exhibition of paintings by Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla in 1909 and was inspired to go to Spain. His paintings from Spain in 1910 were exhibited in New York City in spring 1911, where Sorolla saw them and brought Archer Milton Huntington, the founder of the HSM&amp;L, to the exhibition. Huntington acquired at least three pictures and three watercolors. Other Americans followed suit, such as George Wharton Edwards (1859-1950), the Connecticut-born artist and art director of <em>Collier\u2019s Magazine, <\/em>whose work is also on view at the start of the show.<\/p>\n<p>The exhibition continues with additional works by Edwards, as well as those by Florence Vincent Robinson (1874-1937), the Boston watercolorist active throughout Europe, and Timothy J. Clark, focusing on the three artists\u2019 watercolor paintings of the Alhambra in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. This section of the exhibition is further enhanced by decorative arts objects from the Alhambra region.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Continuing along the exhibition, visitors will find works of oil sketch panels in vitrines by\u00a0Hassam and\u00a0Max Kuehne (1880-1968), the German-born New York artist, active in Granada\u00a0and\u00a0areas of Old Castile (Salamanca, Burgos, and Segovia), 1914-23. Works from Daniel Zuloaga\u2019s ceramics studio in Segovia are also on display.<\/p>\n<p>The next area of the exhibition features works that highlight additional regions in Spain, including Old Castile and Toledo. Among the pieces in this section\u00a0are works\u00a0by Milan Petrovic (1893-1978) \u2013 a Serbian-born United States artist who made watercolors in Spain and Morocco (1927)\u00a0\u2013 including a stunning depiction of the Toledo Cathedral Tower. As the exhibition continues, the artworks begin to showcase regions west of Toledo into Extremadura and southern Old Castile (Talavera, Escorial, Plasencia, \u00c1vila), with pieces by Ernest Clifford Peixotto (1869-1940), the California-born artist, author, muralist and military and arts education administrator of Sephardic Portuguese descent.<\/p>\n<p>Other regions in Spain highlighted throughout the exhibition include Seville and Andaluc\u00eda (C\u00f3rdoba and \u00dabeda), Valencia and Portgual, with various works by Peixotto, Clark and Orville Houghton Peets (1884-1968), the Cleveland-born artist and illustrator subsequently active in Delaware, who was commissioned by Archer Huntington to paint in Spain and Portugal, 1919-1921. An additional segment of works painted in Morocco features a suite of watercolors by Petrovic.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the exhibition closes with a gallery dedicated solely to Clark, featuring his various works complemented by decorative arts objects related to the subject matter and location depicted in the artist\u2019s paintings. Clark was inspired by the Sorolla in America exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Art \u2013 over half of which was provided by the HSM&amp;L \u2013 to conduct several campaigns in Spain and Mexico. Like Hassam and the others before him, Clark depicted monuments, interiors and cityscapes, both with figures and as compositions in themselves, as well as still-life paintings. His works are presented as easel-sized paintings, similar in size to oils, but executed in watercolor.<\/p>\n<p>The exhibition is curated by Dr. Marcus B. Burke, Ph.D., Senior Curator, <em>emeritus<\/em>, Museum Department, along with associates Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez-Ying, Ph.D., Rockefeller Brothers Fund Curatorial Research Fellow for the Hubert &amp; Mireille Goldschmidt Works on Paper Fellowship and Alexandra Frantischek Rodr\u00edguez-Jack, Rockefeller Brothers Fund Curatorial Research Fellow for Spanish and Hispanic Art in the Hispanic Sociaty\u2019s Museum &amp; Library\u2019s Collections.
