The Fellows will serve in a part-time capacity at the museum during the 2021-2022 academic year.<\/p>\n<p>The Fellows, Dr. Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez Ying, Alexandra Frantischek Rodr\u00edguez-Jack, Anna Andreeva and Amanda R. Dorval, will be working closety with curators and conservators in the following four areas respectively:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Works on Paper (Drawings and Watercolors), with an Emphasis on Latin American Art \u2013 Additional support provided by Hubert and Mireille Goldschmidt<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This postdoctoral fellowship will be held by Dr. Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez Ying. Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez is a native of Panama with an M.A. in Museum Studies from New York University in New York City, and a doctorate in Art History from the Graduate Center of the City University in New York.\u00a0 A specialist in the art and architecture of colonial (viceregal) and nineteenth-century Latin America, Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez served as a professor and curator in both the United States and Panama, where he was National Coordinator of Museums for the National Institute of Culture in Panama.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez will continue his research on Peruvian nineteenth-century costumbrist watercolors and their dispersion throughout the world, helping to organize a study of the materials and techniques of these works as part of an international humanities-led scientific research project (USA portion sponsored by the NEH). In addition, he will participate in creating an exhibition showcasing North American artists active in Spain and Latin America, slated to open June through September 2022. Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez will also conduct research on the context of the HSM&amp;L\u2019s collection of watercolors by Baron Taylor and his associates for Taylor\u2019s 1826 publication, Voyage pittoresque en Espagne, en Portugal et sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique, de Tanger \u00e0 T\u00e9touan.

Ms. Rodr\u00edguez-Jack will conduct research on women\u2019s estrados in Spain and Latin America from the late medieval period to the nineteenth century. The word, estrado, translates to a raised and carpeted wooden platform with low tables, small furniture and cushions to sit on, used by women. With obvious reference to the Islamic influence in Hispanic culture, the salas de estrado (women\u2019s sitting rooms) became feminine enclaves within houses and were arenas for a feminine culture all their own. Ms. Rodr\u00edguez-Jack\u2019s study will seek to clarify the ways this tradition passed from the Iberian Peninsula to the New World and how it affected art and design as an original, localized and unique practice by examining guilds in particular indigenous and malato craftspeople.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Rodr\u00edguez-Jack will also serve as a curatorial associate in the HSM&amp;L Museum Department, involved in registration of objects, cataloguing and computer-related projects. She will collaborate with HSM&amp;L Department curators Dr. Noem\u00ed Espinosa and Dr. Marcus Burke, and also with Dr. Margaret Connors McQuade, Curator of Decorative Arts and Deputy Director.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conservation Treatments in Spanish and Latin American Works of Art and Design with an Emphasis on Textiles<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This fellowship will be held by Anna Andreeva, a Russian-born \u00e9migr\u00e9 who is a textile conservator and scholar of Hispanic culture. With a Master of Arts in Fashion and Textile Studies (History, Theory, Museum Practice) from the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, Ms. Andreeva is a master textile conservator with expertise in tapestries and large-scale textiles, and has been a part-time conservation assistant on the staff of the Textile Conservation Lab at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Andreeva will work with Latin American textiles, mantones de Manila, or Chinese-style embroidered shawls marketed through the Philippines, and other luxury textiles, and in the further organization and development of textile storage systems, as well as basic registration and cataloguing.\u00a0 She will collaborate with Maestra H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fontoira Marzin, Head of the Conservation Department at the HSM&amp;L, and curators Dr. Noem\u00ed Espinosa and Dr. Marcus Burke.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Spanish and Latin American Manuscripts, Rare Books and Documents with an Emphasis on Arabic language and Islamic related materials<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This fellowship will be held by Amanda R. Dorval, a Puerto Rican and Dominican-American who is a specialist in the Spanish and Arabic languages. Staff Sargent Dorval (Air Force Reserve) is completing a master\u2019s degree at Long Island University\u2019s Palmer School of Library and Information Science in Brookville, New York, with a concentration in Rare Books and Special Collections.
