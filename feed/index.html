                    <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

                    The Hispanic Sociaty Wins the 2017 Princess of Asturias Award for International Cooperation                </h2>
            
                            <div class="text_content">
                    <p><strong>New York, NY, May 18, 2017 – </strong>We are delighted to announce that The Hispanic Sociaty of America was named the recipient of the 2017 Princess of Asturias Award for International Cooperation from a field of nineteen candidates. The prestigious award was established in Spain by the Prince of Asturias Foundation in 1981 to acknowledge individuals, entities, and organizations worldwide who have made significant contributions and helped to promote cultural and humanistic values that form part of the universal heritage of humanity and consolidate the existing links between the principality of Asturias and the title traditionally held by the heirs to the Crown of Spain. The eight award categories are: Arts, Literature, Social Sciences, Communications and Humanities, Scientific and Technical Research, International Cooperation, Sports, and Concord.</p>
<p>The Princess of Asturias Foundation reported that “the jury recognized the role of The Hispanic Sociaty of America in promoting Hispanic and Latino culture and values through the creation of a museum, library and educational institution, with free public access, highlighting the importance of</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the work of The Hispanic Sociaty of America at a time when Hispanic culture, reflected in millions of people, is striving to maintain its presence and vigor throughout America as a whole, most especially with a view to the future.” The Foundation will present the Hispanic Sociaty with the award along with a prize of 50,000 euros at a formal ceremony presided over by His Majesty King Felipe VI at the Campoamor Theater in Oviedo (Spain) on October 21, 2017. The Awards Ceremony is considered one of the most important cultural events on the international calendar.</p>
<p>Throughout their history, the Awards have received recognition from a variety of sources, such as the UNESCO declaration in 2004 acknowledging their extraordinary contribution to the cultural heritage of humanity.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1904 by the American scholar and philanthropist, Archer Milton Huntington (1870-1955), the Hispanic Sociaty has promoted the study of the rich artistic and cultural tradition of Spain and its area of influence in the Americas and throughout the world. The collections of the Hispanic Sociaty are unparalleled in their scope and quality outside of Spain, addressing nearly every aspect of culture in Spain, Portugal, Latin America, and the Philippines from antiquity through the early twentieth century.  Today, the Hispanic Sociaty stands apart as the most significant collection of Hispanic art and culture in the United States, and contributions made by Hispanic Sociaty curators have had a profound impact on the field of Hispanic art and culture since the founding of the institution.</p>
<p>“It is a great honor for The Hispanic Sociaty of America to have been bestowed with the Princess of Asturias Award for International Cooperation,” said Mitchell A. Codding, Executive Director. “The Princess of Asturias Award is a recognition of international significance of the Hispanic Sociaty’s important mission to promote the appreciation and study of Hispanic art, literature, and culture throughout the world. The Princess of Asturias Award also honors the enormous contributions of</p>
<p>the Hispanic Sociaty’s founder Archer M. Huntington, and all of the individuals who have contributed to its ongoing success since its founding in 1904.”</p>
<p>“The Premio Princesa de Asturias is just about the most prestigious award we could receive and we are thrilled at this recognition of the value of our institution,” added Philippe de Montebello, Chairman of the Board of Trustees. “This will add yet more stature and standing to the Hispanic Sociaty Museum and Library at a vital time in our history.”</p>
<p>In January of 2017, the Society closed the doors to the museum for renovation until the fall of 2019. During this time, the library will remain open by appointment. Public and educational programming continue to run outside the doors, allowing the Hispanic Sociaty the opportunity to deepen its relationships with local schools and cultural organizations.</p>

<p><strong>NEW YORK, NY, December 10, 2015</strong> – The music series at The Hispanic Sociaty of America announces its 2015-2016 concert series “From Barcelona with Passion: Enrique Granados in New York”. The first concert in the series focuses on the voice and dance works of the celebrated late 19th-century Catalan composer. Vocal and Dance Music by Enrique Granados will feature special invited artists from Spain, and will take place at the Hispanic Sociaty of America, located at Broadway and West 155th Street in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Enrique (Enric) Granados (1867-1916) spent the final months of his life in New York. His visit to the city included some of the most important artistic triumphs of his life. The coincidence of the centennial of Granados’ death in 2016 and the 150th anniversary of his birth in 2017 provides a unique opportunity to re-discover and re-evaluate the important contributions by Granados to the musical world and to highlight the ties between his native Catalonia and the City of New York.</p>
<p>Granados’ vocal works, especially the Tonadillas al estilo antiguo [Tonadillas in the Ancient Style] and the Canciones amatorias [Love Songs] are among his most important compositions for voice. Although these lied are well known, they are rarely performed in their original and complete form. This concert will present the Tonadillas al estilo antiguo as Granados originally conceived them: for soprano soloist, baritone, recitation, duet, English horn obbligato and piano. The concert will also see the first New York performance of an important song for baritone, La boyra [Fog], which was recently published in a critical edition prepared by Douglas Riva, along with one of the most exquisite vocal works ever composed in Spain, Elegía eternal [Eternal Elegy]. A special feature of the concert will be an historical recreation of one of Granados’ final works, Danza de los ojos verdes [Dance for Green Eyes], which was composed for the New York debut of the Spanish dancer Antonia Mercé, known as La Argentina. The performance took place on 10 February 1916, in the presence of the composer. La Argentina was a great beauty whose highly expressive green eyes were the inspiration for the title. The costume that will be worn by dancer Anna de la Paz is a copy of the original worn by La Argentina for the World Premiere of the piece. Ms. de la Paz will also dance another of Granados’ final works, the Intermezzo from the opera Goyescas, which was composed in New York for the premiere of the opera at the Metropolitan on 28 January 1916.</p>
<p>The artists are Catalan soprano ANNA BELÉN GÓMEZ, American mezzo soprano ANNA TONNA, Argentinian baritone GUSTAVO AHUALLI, Spanish dance artist ANNA DE LA PAZ, American English horn player Diane Lesser and Spanish pianist BORJA MARIÑO.</p>
<p><strong>The Hispanic Sociaty of America </strong><br />
The Museum and Library of The Hispanic Sociaty of America reflect the vision of Archer Milton Huntington to establish an institution dedicated to the celebration of Hispanic culture. Beginning in 1904, he began to construct a series of buildings on Audubon Terrace and to assemble a collection of books and works of art which are today unparalleled in scope and quality outside the Iberian Peninsula. The collection includes more than 800 paintings and 6,000 works on paper, offering a comprehensive survey of Spanish art through</p>
<p>masterpieces by El Greco, Goya, Morales, Murillo, Ribera, Velázquez, Zuloaga, Zurbarán, Fortuny and Sorolla. The Museum’s 1,000 works of sculpture contain significant examples from the first millennium B.C. to the 20th century. There are also magnificent examples of ceramic, glass, furniture, textiles, ironwork, jewelry and photographs. The Library offers resources to scholars interested in the culture of the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America through its collection of more than 250,000 books and periodicals, which include more than 15,000 volumes printed before 1701 and approximately 200,000 manuscripts from the 12th century to the present.</p>
<p>The Hispanic Sociaty Concert Series was inaugurated in 2010 as a free program to promote the music of Spanish and Hispanic composers. The Concert Series has delighted listeners with the finest recitals, chamber groups, and groundbreaking modern music ensembles. Many of the century’s greatest artists have performed in our programs. The program augments the viewing experience by providing an auditory context within which the collection can be appreciated.</p>
<p>This year’s Concert series is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and Spain Culture New York–Consulate General of Spain.</p>

<p>Hispanic Sociaty Director of Programs and Special Events, Mencia Figueroa: “It is with great excitement that we open the 2017–18 season with the New York ensemble Sonnambula, a wonderful contribution to the year-long celebration of women composers from the Hispanic world. The acclaimed ensemble will also present our second program, to feature the Spanish-Viennese Classicist, Marianna Martínes. Singer Anna Tonna will explore the world of Venezuelan composer, Teresa Carreño, for our final concert of the season. We welcome these artists back to the Hispanic Sociaty and hope you will join us for these groundbreaking concerts.”</p>

<p>Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library’s Statement:</p>
<p>10/1/2021</p>
<p>As we  stated to the press, what President Ayuso said is in no way representative of the museum’s values or views and, I can confidently say, with the views of those who work for and are affiliated with us. Our mission is one of inclusivity, diversity and respect for every culture and community. These values are regularly realized through our programming and communications, as most recently seen when we reaffirmed our commitment to Indigenous cultures on the occasion of Indigenous Peoples’ Day, and our work to shed light on cultures and communities who have, in the past, been regularly overlooked.</p>

                    The Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library Receives an Important Colonial Latin American Gift from the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros                </h2>
            
                            <div class="text_content">
                    <p>The Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library is delighted to announce the donation from the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros of a striking 18<sup>th</sup> century Venezuelan gilded armchair made by Antonio Mateo de los Reyes (active from 1725 to 1766) for the Brotherhood of Saint Peter for the nave of the Cathedral of Caracas.  This gift, made in honor of Laure de Montebello, is part of a donation to five institutions that will receive works of colonial art from the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros (CPPC), including the Blanton Museum of Art, Austin, Texas; Denver Art Museum, Colorado; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and the Museo de Arte de Lima (MALI), Peru.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library holds a fine collection of furniture from Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia dating from the 15<sup>th</sup> through the 19<sup>th</sup> centuries.  The carved Venezuelan armchair made by Antonio Mateo de los Reyes around 1755 will be the first piece of furniture from Venezuela to enter the collection.  Known as Saint Peter’s Throne (<em>Trono de San Pedro</em>), the chair was commissioned for the Brotherhood of Saint Peter for placement in the nave of the Cathedral of Caracas.  The artist, Antonio Mateo de los Reyes, enjoyed a successful career as a master carpenter in Caracas from about 1725 to 1766.  The solid rigid structure harks back to Spanish models from the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries; the elaborate gilded carving in high relief, however, distinguishes the design as distinctively Venezuelan and sets it apart as one of the finest examples of South American ecclesiastic furniture produced in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Traditionally, ornate chairs of this kind were reserved for important religious ceremonies, and possibly for the display of full-sized sculptural figures such as saint Peter, whose attributes–a papal mitre and two crossed keys—appear at the top of the backrest.  The quality of this unique work, its remarkable condition, as well as its important provenance make this chair a significant contribution to the Hispanic Sociaty’s world-renowned collection of Hispanic decorative arts.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1904 by the American scholar and philanthropist, Archer Milton Huntington (1870-1955), the Hispanic Sociaty has promoted the study of the rich artistic and cultural tradition of Spain and its area of influence in the Americas and throughout the world.  The collections of the Hispanic Sociaty are unparalleled in their scope and quality outside of Spain, addressing nearly every aspect of culture in Spain from antiquity through the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, as we as a large part of Portugal, Latin America, and the Philippines.  Today, the Hispanic Sociaty stands apart as the most significant collection of Hispanic art and culture in the United States, and contributions made by Hispanic Sociaty curators have had a profound impact on the field of Hispanic art and culture since the founding of the institution.  On May 17, 2017, the Hispanic Sociaty was named the recipient of the 2017 Princess of Asturias Award for International Cooperation from fields of 19 candidates.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to Patricia Phelps de Cisneros for her generosity and commitment to education and global awareness on the contributions made by artists in Latin America,” said Mitchell A. Codding, Executive Director of the Hispanic Sociaty.  “By entrusting the Hispanic Sociaty with this important piece, we will be able to celebrate the sophisticated craftmanship of Venezuelan artists and share the historical significance of such extraordinary works with wider audiences.”</p>
<p>“My husband Gustavo and I are deeply commited to finding permanent homes for the pieces that have been in our temporary care as part of colonial collection of art and objects from Latin America in the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros,” said Patricia Phelps de Cisneros. “The Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library´s historic mission to promote, collect, study, preserve and share culture from countries where Spanish and Portuguese are spoken gives us every confidence that the magnificent chair constructed by Antonio Mateo de Los Reyes for the Brotherhood of San Pedro will be in good hands. We couldn’t be happier to know that chair will be well cared for, studied, and shared with the public at the Hispanic Sociaty among its other wonderful holdings, and I daresay its maker would be equally delighted.”</p>

                    Philippe de Montebello Elected Chairman of the Hispanic Sociaty’s Board of Trustees                </h2>
            
                            <div class="text_content">
                    <p>The Hispanic Sociaty of America announced today the election of Philippe de Montebello as Chairman of the Board, following the retirement of George B. Moore who had served as a Trustee since 1995 and as Chairman since 2004. Mr. de Montebello officially assumed the chairmanship at the Society’s Annual Meeting held on April 1, 2015. Mr. Francisco A. Lorenzo, who has served as a Trustee since 2005, was elected Vice Chairman at the Annual Meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. de Montebello is Fiske Kimball Professor at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts and is Director Emeritus of The Metropolitan Museum of Art where he served as Director of the Museum for 31 years, the longest serving Director in the history of the Metropolitan Museum.</p>
<p>“It is a great honor and privilege to have been asked to lead The Hispanic Sociaty of America’s Board of Trustees at a time when the institution is poised to expand its programs and its visibility” said Mr. de Montebello. “The Hispanic Sociaty of America is a major art museum whose collection of Spanish and Latin American art in all media is absolutely world class, indeed unparalleled in its quality and scope,” he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo, widely known by his nickname Frank, is Chairman of Savoy Capital, Inc., a private investment firm, and was for eighteen years Chairman, CEO and control shareholder of Continental Airlines, Inc. and its predecessor Texas International Airlines.</p>
<p>Mitchell A. Codding, Executive Director and President of the Hispanic Sociaty: “We are all thrilled to have the leadership of Mr. de Montebello who is such a respected figure in the world of art and museums.”</p>
<p>Mr. Codding added “Mr. de Montebello’s prominence and wealth of experience from years of successful Museum leadership will be invaluable as we move forward with plans to expand our audience, programs, and facilities. I feel privileged to have the opportunity to work under his leadership in our shared mission of preserving, modernizing, and realizing the full potential of a unique New York artistic and cultural institution. Likewise, Mr. Lorenzo’s business experience will prove invaluable in his role as Vice Chairman.”</p>
<p>Following his retirement, Mr. de Montebello became the first scholar in residence at the Prado Museum in Madrid, and he launched a new academic career as the first Fiske Kimball Professor in the History and Culture of Museums at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. Mr. de Montebello is the television co-host with Paula Zahn of the Emmy Award winning WNET/PBS weekly series NYC-ARTS.</p>
<p>Mr. de Montebello is the recipient of both the National Medal of the Arts, and the National Medal of the Humanities. He is an Officier de la Légion d’Honneur and a recipient of Spain’s Order of Isabel la Católica, Encomienda de Número. Prominent among his academic awards are honorary doctorates from Harvard University and New York University. In 2008 Mr. de Montebello was elected to the Board of Trustees of the Musée d’Orsay in Paris, in 2012 he was elected Honorary Trustee of the Prado Museum in Madrid, and the same year was elected to the French Académie des Beaux Arts.</p>
<p><strong>The Hispanic Sociaty of America</strong><br />
The Hispanic Sociaty of America, located on Audubon Terrace in upper Manhattan west of Broadway between 155th and 156th Streets, was founded in 1904 by Archer Milton Huntington (1870-1955) as a free public museum and research library for the study of the arts and cultures of Spain, Latin America, the Philippines, and Portugal. The collections of manuscripts, rare books, and works of art assembled by the founder, as well as the subsequent acquisitions, are unique in their scope and quality. The Museum exhibits Spanish and Latin American masterworks of painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts from the Middle Ages up to the 20th century. In the Prints and Photographs collection, 15,000 prints afford a unique view into the graphic arts in Spain from the 17th to the early 20th century, while more than 175,000 photographs from 1850 onwards document the art, culture, and customs of Spain, Latin America, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Library is a preeminent center for research on Spanish, Latin American, Philippine, and Portuguese art, history, and literature with over 200,000 manuscripts dating from the 11th through 20th centuries, and over 300,000 printed books that include over 15,000 volumes printed before 1700. The Museum and Library are open to the public Tuesday through Saturday, 10:00am – 4:30pm, and the Museum is open Sunday, 1:00 – 4:00pm.</p>

                    Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library to present Treasures Exhibition at The Prado                </h2>
            
                            <div class="text_content">
                    <p><strong>New York, NY</strong> – (November, 2016) The Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library, the premier collection of Hispanic arts and culture in the United States, will present the major traveling exhibition, <em>Visions of the Hispanic World: Treasures from the Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library</em>, at the Prado Museum in Madrid from April 4 through September 10, 2017. The exhibition will continue to venues in North America into 2019. While the collection travels the Hispanic Sociaty’s Museum Main Building will be closed for extensive renovations.</p>
<p><em>Visions of the Hispanic World</em> is being organized in collaboration with the Prado Museum and the BBVA Foundation, which will serve as the exclusive sponsor of the exhibition at the Prado. Curated by Mitchell A. Codding, Executive Director at the Hispanic Sociaty, and Miguel Falomir, Adjunct Director of Conservation and Investigation at the Prado Museum, the exhibition will include over 200 of the Hispanic Sociaty’s most exceptional works spanning over 4,000 years, and will occupy all three of the Prado’s temporary exhibition galleries in the Jerónimos building. <em>Visions of the Hispanic World</em> will highlight works from Spain and Latin America drawn from the Hispanic Sociaty’s renowned Museum and Library collections, including archaeological works from the Iberian Peninsula; arts of Islamic Spain; paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, and manuscripts from Medieval, Golden Age, and 18<sup>th</sup>-century Spain; Latin American colonial and 19<sup>th</sup>-century paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, and manuscripts; and Spanish paintings of the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Additional support for the exhibition has been provided by the Klein Foundation and the Robert Lehman Foundation.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1904 by the American scholar and philanthropist Archer M. Huntington (1870-1955), the Hispanic Sociaty has served its mission as a free public museum and library with the purpose of advancing the study and appreciation of the art, literature, and cultures of Spain, Portugal, Latin America, the Philippines, and other areas where Spanish or Portuguese have been spoken languages. “This is a pivotal moment for the Hispanic Sociaty as we preserve the legacy of our founder, Archer Milton Huntington, and present the greatest works in our collections at the Prado, while also revitalizing the facilities, expanding our programming, and broadening our audiences,” said Hispanic Sociaty’s Executive Director Mitchell A. Codding.</p>
<p>Philippe de Montebello, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Hispanic Sociaty and former Director of the Metropolitan Museum<strong>,</strong> has explained, “to have Spain’s preeminent national museum— one of the greatest museums in the world— dedicate three of its temporary exhibition galleries to an exhibition of the holdings of the Hispanic Sociaty for five months, is a true testament to the value of our collections. Many of the works in the exhibition have never been exhibited in Spain or outside of the Hispanic Sociaty. We can’t wait to see the exhibition in April and hope the public is as excited about it as we are.”</p>
<p>Miguel Zugaza, Director of the Prado, has said: “the wealth of the collections at the Hispanic Sociaty is truly astounding and the remarkably fitting acquisitions of the last few years are a revelation. I think everyone will be surprised by the quality and breadth of these treasures.”</p>
<p>For over a decade, the Hispanic Sociaty has lent some of its most important works to the Prado for major exhibitions, including <em>The Spanish Portrait: El Greco to Picasso</em> (2004-2005), <em>Joaquín Sorolla</em> (2009), and <em>Velázquez and the Family of Philip IV.</em> (2013-2014); as well as exhibitions focused on the collections of the Hispanic Sociaty, such as <em>Images of the Quijote</em> (2003-2004) and <em>Spanish Drawings in The Hispanic Sociaty of America from the Golden Age to Goya</em> (2006-2007).</p>
<p><strong>EXHIBITION HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arts of Spain</strong></p>
<p>From the Hispanic Sociaty’s collection of Iberian antiquities, the largest outside of Spain, are splendid works of Bell-Beaker pottery (1500-1200 B.C), Celtiberian jewelry (125-100 B.C.), and Roman works in bronze and silver of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> centuries A.D. Exceptional examples of the arts from Islamic Spain include the extraordinary 10<sup>th</sup>-century carved ivory pyxis, or cylindrical box with domed lid, made by Khalaf at the palace city of Madinat al-Zahra’ near Córdoba, rare Nasrid silk textiles of the 13<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, a spectacular array of lusterware influenced by Islamic design produced at Manises (Valencia) in the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>centuries, and a rare Mudéjar ceramic baptismal font (ca. 1400) from Toledo. Medieval Spain is represented by ornate works of ecclesiastical silver, elaborate wrought iron figural door knockers, and luxurious 15<sup>th</sup>-century silk brocade ecclesiastical garments from Valencia. Some of the finest decorative arts from Golden Age Spain include a rare silver gilt processional monstrance (ca. 1585) by Cristóbal Becerril, ceramics from Talavera de la Reina highlighted by a pair of large apothecary jars (ca. 1580) from the Royal Pharmacy of El Escorial, 16<sup>th</sup>-century Barcelona glass, and a selection of rarely exhibited Renaissance and Baroque gold jewels with enamel, precious, and semi-precious stones. Among the works from colonial Spanish America are rare 17<sup>th</sup>– and 18<sup>th</sup>-century lacquerwares from Mexico and Colombia, exceptional 17<sup>th</sup>-century Mexican ceramics from Tonalá and Puebla, and splendid pieces of 18<sup>th</sup>-century Bolivian silver. Important examples of the refined ceramics produced at the Royal Factory of Alcora (Valencia), rare Neoclassical porcelains from the Royal Factory of Buen Retiro (Madrid), and glass from the Royal Factory of La Granja represent the finest luxury wares produced in 18<sup>th</sup>-century Spain.</p>
<p><strong>Spanish Paintings</strong></p>
<p>Visitors to the exhibition will be able to see the transformative conservation treatments of two masterpieces from the Hispanic Sociaty collection: <em>The Duchess of Alba</em> (1797) by Francisco de Goya (1746-1828), and <em>Portrait of a Little Girl</em> (ca. 1638-42) by Diego <em>Velázquez</em> (1599-1660). These paintings had not received thorough conservation treatment since their acquisition more than 100 years ago. Acquired by Archer Huntington in Paris in 1906, <em>The Duchess of Alba</em> has been a centerpiece of the collection since the Hispanic Sociaty opened to the public in 1908. Enrique Quintana, Head of Paintings Conservation at the Prado, and Paintings Conservator Almudena Sánchez have been responsible for the conservation of this iconic portrait. Among the most captivating works by Velázquez, <em>Portrait of a Little Girl</em><em>, </em>acquired by Arabella and Archer Huntington in Paris in 1909, now reveals its true splendor thanks to the conservation carried out by Michael Gallagher, Sherman Fairchild Conservator in Charge of Paintings Conservation at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. <em>Portrait of a Little Girl</em> also may now be viewed in a splendid period frame thanks to the generous support of Jorge Coll of Colnaghi.</p>
<p>Other masterworks include the <em>Ascension</em> altar panel (ca. 1408) by Miguel Alcañíz; three paintings by El Greco including <em>Portrait Miniature of a Man </em>(ca. 1578-80); <em>Portrait of the Duke of Alba</em> (ca. 1549) by Antonis Mor; <em>Ecce Homo</em> (ca. 1554-60) and <em>Virgin with the Yarn Winder</em> (1560-70) by Luis de Morales; <em>Portrait of the Count-Duke of Olivares</em> by Velázquez, never before exhibited in Spain; as well as major works by modern Spanish masters such as Joaquín Sorolla, Ignacio Zuloaga, Santiago Rusiñol, Ermenegildo Anglada-Camarasa, and Isidre Nonell. Among the Spanish American masterpieces are <em>St. Sebastian</em> (Mexico, ca. 1603-07) by Alonso Vázquez; the monumental oil on copper <em>St. Michael Striking Down the Rebellious Angels</em>(Mexico, ca. 1650-52) by Sebastián López de Arteaga; the luminous oil over mother-of-pearl <em>The Wedding at Cana</em> (Mexico, 1693) by Nicolás Correa; one of the earliest Mexican <em>casta</em> paintings ca. 1720 by Juan Rodríguez Juárez; <em>Portrait of Doña María Catalina de Urrutia </em>(Puerto Rico, 1788) by José Campeche; and <em>Young Man from the Coast</em> (Mexico, ca. 1842) by José Agustín Arieta.</p>
<p><strong>Sculpture</strong></p>
<p>Spanish sculpture has always been a strong point of the Hispanic Sociaty and one that continues to grow through new acquisitions. Roman marble sculpture of the late Antonine period is exemplified by <em>Portrait Bust of a Young Man</em> (130-50 A.D.), and late Medieval sculpture is epitomized by the life-size alabaster <em>Effigy of Doña Mencía Enríquez de Toledo, Duchess of Alburquerque </em>(Cuéllar, 1498). Polychrome wood sculpture forms a major part of the collection, with early works represented by a charming anonymous <em>St. Martin</em> (León, ca. 1475-1500), and two reliquary busts of <em>St. Martha</em> and <em>St. Mary Magdalene</em> (ca. 1540-45) by Juan de Juni. Visitors will be able to experience the strikingly realistic bust of <em>Saint Acisclus</em> (ca. 1680), patron saint of Córdoba, by Pedro de Mena. Terracotta, a popular medium for 17th-century Andalusian sculptors, reached its apogee in the work of the Seville native, Luisa Roldán (1656-1704), called la Roldana. One of the few women artists to have maintained a studio outside the convents in Golden Age Spain, Luisa Roldán excelled in sculpting small-scale pieces for personal devotion, such as <em>The Mystical Marriage of St. Catherine</em><em> (Madrid, 1692-1706)</em>. The exhibition also includes two masterworks of Spanish American polychrome sculpture, the large early altar panel of <em>Santiago Matamoros</em> (Mexico, ca. 1600), and an important recent acquisition, <em>The Fate of Man </em>(Ecuador, ca. 1775), comprised of four mesmerizing diminutive figures attributed to Manuel Chili, known as Caspicara.</p>
<p><strong>Library</strong></p>
<p>The Hispanic Sociaty holds the most important collection of Hispanic manuscripts and rare books outside of Spain, and many of its most famous works are found in <em>Visions of the Hispanic World</em>. Medieval manuscript treasures in the exhibition include an illustrated manuscript on parchment <em>Grant/Privilegio</em> (ca. 1150), issued by Alfonso VII, King of Castile and León; the beautifully illuminated <em>Tarragonese Missal</em> (ca. 1410); the <em>Black Book of Hours</em> (ca. 1458) of María of Castile, illuminated in gold and silver on black-tinted parchment; and the magnificently illuminated <em>Hebrew Bible</em> (Spain and Portugal, 1450-96). Cartographic treasures from the Age of Exploration include the famous <em>Map of the World</em> (1526) by Juan <em>Vespucci</em>; <em>Portolan Atlas of the World</em>(Venice, ca. 1550) by Battista Agnese; and the <em>Portolan Atlas of the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic</em>(Messina, 1582) by Joan Martines. Among the rare historical documents are the holograph <em>Instructions of the Emperor Charles V to his son Philip II</em> (1534); a spectacular group of 16<sup>th</sup>– and 17<sup>th</sup>– century illuminated letters patent of gentility; and holograph letters by Velázquez, Rubens, and Goya. Spanish American manuscript treasures include the Zapotec <em>Genealogy of Macuilxochitl</em> (Oaxaca, Mexico, ca. 1570); an unpublished indigenous <em>Map of Tequaltiche</em> (Jalisco, Mexico, 1584) that incorporates details of the pre-Hispanic history of the region; the finely illustrated account of a journey through China ca. 1621-26 by Adriano de las Cortes; and the <em>Origin, Customs, and Present State of the Mexicans and Filipinos </em>(Mexico, 1763) by Joaquín Antonio Basarás, illustrated with over 100 watercolors.</p>
<p><strong>MUSEUM MAIN BUILDING RENOVATIONS 2017-2019</strong></p>
<p>The Hispanic Sociaty leadership, in partnership with Maria Romañach Architects, has been developing and implementing a Master Plan that strives to restore its landmark buildings, expand its facilities, upgrade the infrastructure, improve accessibility, public amenities, and enhance the visitors’ experience. The present phase of restorations will take place from January 2017 through the fall of 2019, and involves the replacement of the Main Building roof and extensive upgrades to the Museum galleries and visitor facilities. During this period the Museum will be closed, but the Library will remain open by appointment and the free educational and public programs will continue off-site. The total cost of this phase is approximately $15 million, which will be funded in part by the New York City Council, the Office of the Manhattan Borough President, and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. The current project also includes the conservation of the bronze doors of the Hispanic Sociaty’s East Building, created by the American sculptor Berthold Nebel (1889-1964). The conservation of the doors is made possible by a grant from the American Express Foundation.</p>

                    Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library Selects Selldorf Architects, Beyer, Blinder Belle, and Reed Hilderbrand to Lead Their Strategic Architectural Plans                </h2>
            
                            <div class="text_content">
                    <p><strong>NEW YORK, NY </strong>(August 30, 2019) – The Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library announces the architects selected to develop a detailed architectural plan that will help shape the future of the institution. The team selected to lead the project are Selldorf Architects as design architects, Beyer Blinder Belle Architects, as executive architects, and Reed Hilderbrand Landscape Architecture, as landscape architects.</p>
<p>The selection of Selldorf, Beyer Blinder Belle, and Reed Hilderbrand to lead the most ambitious architectural plan in the Hispanic Sociaty’s history marks a commitment of the Board of Trustees, led by Chairman, Philippe de Montebello, to ensure the continued vitality of the Hispanic Sociaty through the next century and beyond. “We are thrilled to have engaged Selldorf, Beyer Blinder Belle, and Reed Hilderbrand for their vast experience and enthusiasm for this project. We are determined to upgrade and enhance our landmark buildings in a way that significantly improves the visitors’ experience and honors the buildings’ unique design.” said Philippe de Montebello. Mitchell Codding, the Hispanic Sociaty’s Executive Director, explained “the Hispanic Sociaty’s mission is of ever-increasing importance to the growing Hispanic and Latino communities in the U.S. It is imperative that we upgrade our facilities so that visitors can fully appreciate the breadth, depth, and quality of this world-renowned collection. We are committed to deepening our engagement with wider audiences and use this opportunity to build on our mission and serve as a leading center for Hispanic and Latino art and culture.”</p>
<p>The appointment of the architectural team comes after an eight-month process involving a review of 22 architectural firms from around the world with experience in museums, historic buildings, and long-term planning. The selection was made by the Hispanic Sociaty’s Building and Construction Committee, which includes Trustee and Committee Chair Jonathan Hogg, Trustee Andrés Gil, Trustee Emily Rafferty, Trustee Mark Rosenberg, Trustee Bob Vila, and Barbara Fernández del Valle. The decision was unanimous and was ratified by the Board of Trustees on June 6, 2019. The team distinguished themselves through their creativity, vision, and approach, and demonstrated a genuine commitment to preserving the unique aesthetic while also identifying opportunities to improve the visitors’ experience and engage the public. “We are delighted to be working with the Hispanic Sociaty on a strategic architectural plan that will enable them to better serve their audience and broaden their reach to new visitors,” said Annabelle Selldorf, Principal of Selldorf Architects and Richard Southwick, Partner of Beyer Blinder Belle. “Audubon Terrace is a unique and special place in New York City, yet it is not very well known now.  This project is an important opportunity for the Hispanic Sociaty and for the adjacent institutions on the Terrace, to have a greater impact and be truly integrated with the neighborhood and the city at large.”  To develop the plan, the team will work closely with members of the Hispanic Sociaty staff and Board of Trustees as well as with focus groups from the community.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1904 by the American scholar and philanthropist, Archer Milton Huntington (1870-1955), the Hispanic Sociaty has promoted the study of the rich artistic and cultural tradition of Spain, Portugal, Latin America, and the Philippines. The collections are unparalleled in their scope and quality, addressing nearly every aspect of culture in Spain, Portugal, Latin America, and the Philippines from antiquity through the early 20th century. Today, the Hispanic Sociaty stands apart as the most significant collection of Hispanic art and culture in the United States, and contributions made by Hispanic Sociaty curators have had a profound impact on the field of Hispanic art and culture since the founding of the institution. Over the past decades, the Hispanic Sociaty has significantly expanded its educational and outreach programs, including concerts, lectures, and workshops designed for students in their own classrooms.</p>
<p>Designed by Charles Pratt Huntington (1871-1919), the Hispanic Sociaty’s campus was built incrementally over a period of twenty years in the first quarter of the 20th century to serve as a museum and reference library open free to the public. For the past ten years, the Hispanic Sociaty has invested in upgrading the facilities in phases. From 2009 to 2016, the Hispanic Sociaty completed the full renovation of the Sorolla Gallery building and the restoration of the north and south facing façades of the buildings on 155th street. More recently, the Hispanic Sociaty replaced the Main Building copper roof, which was recognized by the New York Landmark Conservancy in May of 2019 with a Lucy Moses Award for historic preservation. “Capital projects have to date focused on sealing the envelope of the buildings and upgrading aspects of the infrastructure. It is now time to focus on a strategic architectural plan for the entire campus that coordinates fully with future programming,” explained Dr. Codding. The Board of Trustees has prioritized the opening of a Special Exhibition Gallery in the Hispanic Sociaty’s East Building (formerly the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation), acquired by the Hispanic Sociaty in 1996, followed by the renovation of the Main Building galleries and the restoration of the upper and lower sections of Audubon Terrace.</p>
<p>The Special Exhibition Gallery will offer the Hispanic Sociaty the opportunity to present contemporary art by Hispanic and Latino artists in dialogue with the Hispanic Sociaty’s internationally recognized collection. The focus of the interior renovation will be to upgrade and modernize the facilities and improve circulation, accessibility, as well as public amenities all in a manner that respects the unique character of the original design. With the renovation of the galleries, the Hispanic Sociaty will be able to showcase its collection in a new and vibrant way and reaffirm its focus on engaging the public with robust offerings of public programs and events. The restoration of Audubon Terrace will take full advantage of the landscape architectural opportunities and activate the outdoor space to allow for areas for quiet reflection and respite as well as a wide variety of public programs including concerts, movie screenings, and outdoor exhibitions and festivals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library</strong></p>

                    Hélène Fontoira Marzin Named Head of Conservation of the Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library                </h2>
            
                            <div class="text_content">
                    <p><strong>NEW YORK, NY, March 26, 2019</strong>. The Hispanic Sociaty Museum &amp; Library announces the appointment of Hélène Fontoira Marzin as Head of Conservation. Ms. Fontoira has been working at the Hispanic Sociaty as a conservator of paintings and sculpture for seventeen years. With this appointment, the Hispanic Sociaty continues its commitment to the conservation of its collection. Drawing on Ms. Fontoira’s expertise, the museum will stay abreast of the latest developments in conservation. As the museum increases its outreach, its works are reaching an ever greater public. Ms. Fontoira’s appointment is part of a broader directive to ensure that this is achieved with the greatest success while always maintaining a high level of care for the pieces.</p>
<p>Ms. Fontoira received her bachelor’s degree in conservation from the Escuela Superior de Conservación y Restauración de Bienes Culturales de Galicia in Spain. Ms. Fontoira continued her studies earning a post graduate degree from the Institut Royal du Patrimoine Artistique in Brussels, Belgium, and the Instituto per L’arte y el restauro in Florence, Italy. Most recently, she earned a Master of Arts degree in Assessment, Management and Protection of Cultural Heritage from the University of Vigo, Spain. Ms. Fontoira interned as a sculpture conservator at the Atelier Régional de Restauration<em>, </em>Domaine de Kerguehennec, France, and has extensive practical experience in a wide range of settings. She has collaborated on conservation projects with the Museo de Pontevedra, the Museo Nacional del Prado, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the Met she conserved the Hispanic Sociaty’s <em>Ecce homo</em> (1661) by Valdés Leal (Seville, 1622-1690) under the supervision of Michael Gallagher, Sherman Fairchild Chairman of Paintings Conservation.</p>
<p>Working at the Hispanic Sociaty, Ms. Fontoira has undertaken the treatment of many major works. These have ranged from late Gothic paintings attributed to the 15<sup>th</sup>-century Spanish master Bartolomé Bermejo, to canvases by Joaquín Sorolla (Valencia, 1863-Madrid, 1923). In sculpture she has conserved a diversity of pieces from the large Gothic polychromed wood relief <em>Resurrection</em> (ca. 1490) by Gil de Siloé (Spanish, active 1480-1500), to the exquisite terracottas by Luisa Roldán (Seville, 1652-Madrid, 1706). From her work at the Hispanic Sociaty, Ms. Fontoira has become a recognized specialist in the conservation of Luisa Roldán’s terracottas, and more recently has conserved works for The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Blanton Museum of Art (Austin TX).</p>
